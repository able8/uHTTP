HOWTO BUILD:
    Actually, there are two versions of this project, one for xinetd and the other for itself. 
    XINETD:
        make xinetd
    Individual:
        make
    You should config it so that it can run via xinetd. For the XINETD version, an extra arg 
    of root directory should be provided. And when it comes to Individual Version, two extra
    args -- port and root directory should be provided.
